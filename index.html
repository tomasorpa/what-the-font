    <h1>Seven years - Lukas Graham</h1>
    <div class="section seven_years">
      <p>
        Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me<br />"Go make yourself some
        friends, or you'll be lonely"<br />Once, I was seven years old<br />It
        was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section eleven_years">
      <p>
        Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br />By 11,
        smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br />Never rich, so we were out
        to make that steady figure
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section twenty_years">
      <p>
        Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told<br />Before the morning
        sun, when life was lonely<br />I only see my goals, I don't believe in
        failure<br />Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section thirty_years">
      <p>
        Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold<br />We've
        traveled around the world, and we're still roaming<br />I'm still
        learning about life, my woman brought children for me<br />So I can sing
        them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section sixty_years">
      <p>
        Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got 61<br />Remember life and
        then your life becomes a better one<br />I made the man so happy when I
        wrote a letter once<br />I hope my children come and visit, once or
        twice a month<br />Will I think the world is cold? Or will I have a lot
        of children who can warm me?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section final_part">
      <p>
        Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br />Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think
        the world is cold?<br />Or will I have a lot of children who can hold
        me?<br />Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br />Once, I was seven years old, my
        mama told me<br />"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be
        lonely"<br />Once, I was seven years old<br />Once, I was seven years
        old
